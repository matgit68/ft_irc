TODO :

* Parsing
	Test, test and retest raw COMMANDS (not formated by a client) -> nc

===================================================================================================

DONE :

* PART
	Should leave multiple comma separated channels

* CONNECT
	Maybe something about fds is wrong when quitting and reconnecting. Test :

* REGISTRATION
	Commands are possible even if were not registered

* QUIT
	Send ERR msg !
	Quit dont quit :D

* Signals
	CTRL-Z => gestion signal - epoll-wait() ?
	CTRL-C : leaving properly (close fds, delete clients / channels)

* USER
	Clean and verify

* MODE
	Bad behaviour when +o a user in a chan with multiple users

* DISCONNECTION
	send message to users like quit

* JOIN
	RPL message to fix
	pb status user irssi on chan
	Welcome message not complete (should reveive 332, 333, 353 (prefixed) and 366, and :user!mamat@RZ-kvk5j7.fr.orangecustomers.net JOIN :#pouet)

* ERR - RPL messages
	Better format
	Prefixes ? (! / @)
	Some ERR msg are displayed in the wrong window (ie when a command fails (ie you dont have op privilige), we leave the channel and the ERR is displayed on default / : / main / window 1 instead of current chan window. And the chan window is closed !)

* ALL LEAVING COMMANDS (PART, QUIT, KICK, DISCONNECTION)
	check when we leave channels if we are the last user. If so, empty channels should be deleted

* TOPIC
	client changing the topic now see the new topic

* PASS 
	--> password : implement
	ERR_PASSWDMISMATCH (464)
	"<client> :Password incorrect"
	Returned to indicate that the connection could not be registered as the password was either incorrect or not supplied. The text used in the last param of this message may vary.

* NICK (or USER ?)
	when you try to enter with a nick that already in use, server needs to give message : 
		 Irssi: Your nick is owned by Damla Erblang [derblang@RZ-8gm.037.148.45.IP]
